Everything you have undertaken has been with those three objectives uppermost in your mind. And now your life�s work is nearly complete. Your family prospers, the empire is safe, and the gods are the indifferent, callous, bloodthirsty deities they have been since the dawn of time. And yet, they can also be generous, even kind. After a wearisome battle to defend your kingdom, they present you with the opportunity to experience one last great adventure, an offer that is almost beyond comprehension. Grasp it with both hands, Pacorus, and ride to war again, this time against the most dangerous enemy the Parthian Empire has ever faced. But you will not be alone, and the ensuing perils and calamities will seem insignificant when compared to the great miracle the gods have gifted you. �Conqueror� is the sixteenth volume in the Parthian Chronicles series and follows on from �Dura�. Maps of the Parthian Empire and Judea in the 1st century BC can be found on the maps page of my website.",

The great empires are in disarray � ravaged by endless drought, shaken by ferocious earthquakes, and starved of precious tin. Some say the Gods have abandoned mankind.\r\nWhen Tudha ascends the Hittite throne, the burden of stabilizing the realm falls upon his shoulders. Despite his valiant endeavors, things continue to disintegrate; allies become foes, lethal plots arise, and enemy battle horns echo across Hittite lands. Yet this is nothing compared to the colossal, insidious shadow emerging from the west. Crawling unseen towards Tudha�s collapsing Hittite world comes a force unlike any ever witnessed; an immeasurable swarm of outlanders, driven by the cruel whip of nature, spreading fire and destruction: the Sea Peoples. Every age must end. The measure of a man is how he chooses to face it.",

For many, their only experience with that corner of computer science was a terrifying \"compilers\" class that they suffered through in undergrad and tried to blot from their memory as soon as they had scribbled their last NFA to DFA conversion on the final exam.\r\n\r\nThat fearsome reputation belies a field that is rich with useful techniques and not so difficult as some of its practitioners might have you believe. A better understanding of how programming languages are built will make you a stronger software engineer and teach you concepts and data structures you'll use the rest of your coding days. You might even have fun.\r\n\r\nThis book teaches you everything you need to know to implement a full-featured, efficient scripting language. You'll learn both high-level concepts around parsing and semantics and gritty details like bytecode representation and garbage collection. Your brain will light up with new ideas, and your hands will get dirty and calloused.\r\n\r\nStarting from main(), you will build a language that features rich syntax, dynamic typing, garbage collection, lexical scope, first-class functions, closures, classes, and inheritance. All packed into a few thousand lines of clean, fast code that you thoroughly understand because you wrote each one yourself.",

Ayn Cates Sullivan combines her storytelling craft with research to provide readers with great entertainment. Each story includes symbolism, a spirituality developed around the deity, and poems evoking a spiritual atmosphere linked to the character. The stories transport readers into the time of legend and revisits deities and legendary female characters linked to Welsh and British mythology. In this book, the author's research into the myth of the Holy Grail creates beautiful mythical encounters, bringing to life �untold� stories of characters like the Goddess Arianrhod, Blodeuweddi, Iouga, Elen, also known as �Elen of the Ways,� and the Goddess of Sovereignty, Elaine and Dindraine in the Arthurian female Grail Knights.The stories begin with an informative commentary that shares the author�s personal journey and offers elements of myth and the culture around which these characters evolved. The reader will understand the feminine visage of God and the role of some of the heroic women in the lives and history of legendary heroes like Arthur. The literary allusions are manifold in this narrative, and they feature the Lady of the Lake, Morte D�Arthur, and the Arthurian Round Table. One understands the role of women in British mythology and that brave kings were nothing without them: �A king must connect to the spirit of the land through a woman.\" The author reminds us that any nation or tribe that remembers and re-tells the stories of their people carry a torch of light and insight that continues to pass hope from one generation to the next. This is a book that invites wholeness and peace.",

            "description": "The biggest challenge facing many game programmers is completing their game. Most game projects fizzle out, overwhelmed by the complexity of their own code. Game Programming Patterns tackles that exact problem. Based on years of experience in shipped AAA titles, this book collects proven patterns to untangle and optimize your game, organized as independent recipes so you can pick just the patterns you need.\r\n\r\nYou will learn how to write a robust game loop, how to organize your entities using components, and take advantage of the CPUs cache to improve your performance. You'll dive deep into how scripting engines encode behavior, how quadtrees and other spatial partitions optimize your engine, and how other classic design patterns can be used in games.",

Their mission is to study from orbit the two species of intelligent lifeforms on the surface. The first: an isolated people embarking on civilization and building their world's first city.

            "description": "In her book Legends of the Grail, author Ayn Cates Sullivan takes the reader on a journey of discovery, uncovering the fascinating details of some of Ireland�s most famous Goddesses. Throughout history, some of these legendary figures were seen in a negative light, making them appear cruel and unjust. However, the author has retold their stories in this book and the reader is given a different insight into the misunderstood myths surrounding these famous goddesses. Each chapter starts with an introduction to a particular goddess and then a story or legend that is associated with her. In an interesting twist, the author has chosen to tell each story from the point of view of the goddess, which is rare and allows the reader to really explore these legends in a new way. Many times these stories are told from the point of view of the human who saw a glimpse of light in the distance, or a shift in the shadows at night and claimed it was a goddess approaching. However, in this book the reader is able to open up a whole new world as these stories are told in a way that explains their supernatural occurrences while at the same time being easily relatable. In addition, each chapter contains information about what represents each goddess including colors, plants, and animals. This adds to the idea that each of these goddesses can be seen, felt, or heard anytime we happen to be walking through the woods or strolling by a bubbling stream. Some of the goddesses that were misunderstood include a solar goddess by the name of Aine, who in myths was shown to be a bad and disrespectful wife of King Ailill. However, when author Ayn Cates Sullivan shines some light on this particular myth she reveals that in fact Aine just held her freedom and independence above all else, which are admirable qualities. She uses this freedom and independence to be available when someone calls her that needs a light in their lives. After all she was a solar goddess and wanted to make sure she was there to help anyone who was in need of her help. Then there was the goddess Cailleach who would many times disguise herself as an old woman, or a terrible giantess who would throw boulders out of her apron pockets. In reality, she was adamant about protecting the land, animals, and plants, for she had a deep love of nature, and would only punish those who disrespected it. Meditations and visualizations are offered to allow intimate contact with the Goddess herself. The author includes personal practical suggestions for utilizing the archetypal values embedded symbolically and firmly in the specified Goddess in order to facilitate psychological revival and continued health, and finally a poetic blessing to access the less structured but higher nature of the human mind.",
